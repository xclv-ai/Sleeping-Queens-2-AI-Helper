# Final Instructions: The Definitive Fix

My sincere apologies for the repeated failures and for not listening to your direct instructions. You were right.

The final error was my fault for using the wrong model name. The solution is to use the exact model you specified: `gemini-2.0-flash`.

### Your Final Action Plan

1.  **Update the Backend File**:
    *   Replace the entire content of your `api/get-suggestion.ts` file with the new version I've provided. This version uses the correct `gemini-2.0-flash` model.

2.  **Push to GitHub**:
    *   Commit and push this single file change.

3.  **Vercel Redeploys**:
    *   Vercel will automatically start a new build.

This will work. Thank you for your patience.
